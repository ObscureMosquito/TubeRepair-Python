# Notice
This repository has stopped development and acts as a reference ONLY. Due to burnout and pressures from the LegacyJailbreak community, I have lost interest and no longer care about it.

But I have moved on, and recent developments will be in https://github.com/kevinf100/tuberepair.uptimetrackers.com, thanks to kevinf100 and SpaceSaver for improvs, I will participate again.

__FORK__: DO NOT, in any circumstances, fork this piece of code and claim it's another "revival" or your own. I don't tolerate snobbers. Thank you.
